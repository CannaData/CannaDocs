**(NOTE TO NAYELI: For specific items there is a problem in that you are forced to select a single discount, and quantity for all the specific items. It would be better if they could select different discounts and quantities for the individual items. When you send me code for menu I may use a version of that to recreate the specific item part. I'd appreciate your thoughts here.)**

### Coupon Info

You can view information about existing coupons by selecting them in the search box in the top. The coupon info page provides basic information that can be edited as well as a list of current inventory that is discounted when the coupon is active.
