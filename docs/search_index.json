Each client receives a seperate Virtual Private Cloud instance where their data is securely stored. When you create an account with CannaData you will be given a unique url for your dispensary. For example, a dispensary named “storename” would likely receive the domain https://storename.cannadata.com where they can securely access the CannaData platform. An elegent, and up-to-date menu is readily available at https://storename.cannadata.com/menu, which can easily be integrated into your dispensaries webpage. CannaData is not simply a piece of software. We are your go-to data, and technology consultant. Once your dispensary is integrated into our data pipeline, we offer a variety of custom business services including reporting/analytics, tax planning, A/B testing for marketing campaigns, patient surveys, and more. This documentation explains how to use the CannaData platform’s 4 primary applicaitions. 1.1 Contact We love getting feedback! Please email Carl Ganz "],
["frontdesk.html", "Chapter 2 Frontdesk 2.1 Returning Patients 2.2 New Patients", " Chapter 2 Frontdesk The Frontdesk is where every dispensary first makes contact with their patrons. Dispensaries must keep track of all patrons, and verify that they are valid medical marijuana patients. This requires checking-in each patron when they enter the store. The CannnaData Frontdesk application provides facilities for: Checking-in patients Adding new patients 2.1 Returning Patients For returning patients, the front desk is responsible for: Validating the returning patient is who they say they are Making sure their medical card is still valid Controlling how many patients are allowed in the store at one time, and making sure that patients are processed in the correct order All patient interactions begin by scanning the patient’s state issued ID. For returning patients this will pull up the patient’s profile where the budtender can quickly see the patient’s current medical status, as well as other basic information about the patient. Returning Patient Info (NOTE TO NAYELI: I don’t know if the images are placed optimally in the patient info page. I tried this alternative set-up that may have potential but didn’t really work out as I hoped. I’d appreciate your thoughts here.) Alternative Returning Patient Info This makes it easy to verify that the patient’s medical card is still valid. You can also access a patient’s info page by either searching for them in search box in the top, or by selecting them from the All Patients table. All Patient Table For valid patients, the budtender has buttons at the top that allow them to let the patient directly into the store, or if there is a line to get in to the store, they can add the patient to a queue. Returning Patient Buttons 2.1.1 Queue The homepage of the Frontdesk app keeps track of who is currently in the store, and who is currently in line to get in the store (queue). These tables make it easy to see who is next in line, and how long people have been waiting. Queue 2.1.2 Charts The patient info page provides charts and tables that are useful to the budtender. This includes: The number of reward points the patient has accumulated (and how many more points they need to get a prize) Which types of products the patient has bought in the past Details of past transactions Charts Patient History 2.1.3 Updating Info When a patient’s medical card expires they have to get a new card, and bring that information to the dispensary. All information in the patient info page is editable including the medical card info, and patient images. Edit Medical Info Edit Images 2.2 New Patients For new patients, when their ID is scanned a message will appear indicating that the patient is new. The budtender has the option to add the new patient which initiates the patient sign-up process. Add New Patient Screen When the patient’s ID is first scanned, the information from their ID is automatically added. The budtender uploads the patient’s documents, and enter a small amount of information from the patient’s medical card, specifically the name of their doctor, the expiration date, and the medical card ID number. Empty New Patient Form Completed New Patient Form While the budtender enters this information, the patient is presented with an iPad (or other tablet or computer) where they enter their information into the Signup application discussed below. 2.2.1 Signup The Signup application works in conjunction with the Frontdesk app to let new patients quickly join a dispensary. When a new patient’s ID is scanned they are added to the database, but their profile is incomplete. The budtender must input some information (discussed above), and the patient must complete the signup form (and sign the patient agreement), before they can enter the store. The first page of the signup form contains an input where the budtender can select the incomplete profile of the new patient. Select A New Patient Once the incomplete profile is selected the budtender would hand the iPad over to the new patient who would fill out the rest of the form. The first page of the signup form is automatically filled in based on the information on the patient’s driver’s license. Autofilled Basic Info There are three additional pages where the patient fills in their contact info, and preferences. Preference Info (NOTE TO NAYELI: I think the patient preference input is an area where we can be creative. In liue of the plain old checkboxes we could use cool icons representing flower, concentrate, edibles, etc.) After the patient completes the form they are automatically sent to a page where they digitally sign the new patient agreement contract. This makes the signup process completely paperless. "],
["inventory.html", "Chapter 3 Inventory 3.1 New Inventory 3.2 Past Products 3.3 Wholesaler", " Chapter 3 Inventory The Inventory Management application provides facilities for: Adding new inventory and new wholesalers Viewing the performance of past products and wholesalers Checking quantities of current stock Updating/editing information about existing products Print labels/barcodes for inventory 3.1 New Inventory The new inventory page allows you to enter new shipments of inventory into your database. Digitally managing inventory doesn’t just make it easier to keep track of products, but it also simplifies the record keeping process required for taxes, and other regulations. There are several required fields in the new inventory form: Product Type (i.e. flower vs concentrate vs edible etc.) Strain (No strain is an option, but must be explicitely selected) Wholesaler Wholesale price Quantity Price There are also several optional inputs, and inputs that are only required sometimes: Product Name (required if no strain selected) Description THC &amp; CBD levels Whether product is Indica/Sativa/Hybrid Image Source product and quantity (i.e. if you take 50 grams of Banana OG and make 75 joints, when you enter the 75 joints you would also want to remove the 50 grams of Banana OG that the joints are derived from) 3.1.1 Pricing The price input contains default values based on the product type. Whenever a value in the price input is updated, the rows below the changed value, representing the price for larger quantities, are updated to be consistent with the new value. For example, the default price for concentrates is $30 per half gram. This rate is used for higher quantities so 1 gram is $30*2=$60, two grams is $30*4=$120, etc. We can update the price for two grams to $100, which translates to $50 per gram. Now all quantities above two grams are priced at the $50 per gram rate, while all quantities below two grams retain the $30 per half gram ($60 per gram) rate. Price Input with 2 g level manually set to $100 3.2 Past Products Details about existing and past products are easily accessible. You can search for any past inventory and all wholesalers in the search box at the top. You can also view current inventory in the current inventory table. Current Inventory Table When you select an item you are taken to the product information page. This includes a variety of tables regarding the specific product with the option to edit. Buttons at the top allow to quickly add more inventory and print barcodes for the product. Current Inventory Table Basic analytics are provided so you can quickly see how the product is performing. Daily sales are charted, and average daily profit is rated against other similar products. Current Inventory Table 3.3 Wholesaler You can also view information about specific wholesalers. When you select an item the item’s wholesaler is available in the wholesaler page. You can also select a wholesaler in the search box at the top. Current Inventory Table Analytics about the wholesaler including daily sales, average daily profit, and product type. "],
["connect.html", "Chapter 4 Connect 4.1 Coupons 4.2 Messages", " Chapter 4 Connect Many dispensaries try to encourage patients to come to their store with coupons, and targeted messages. The Connect Application provides facilities for: Creating coupons/deals Reaching out to patients via text, or email 4.1 Coupons 4.1.1 New Coupons The required information for a new coupon is: A name A discount (either a flat amount i.e. $10, or a percentage i.e. 10%) A minimum (either a minimum total amount spent i.e. $60, or a quantity i.e. 3.5 grams) Which products the discount applies to.

It would be better if they could select different discounts and quantities for the individual items. When you send me code for menu I may use a version of that to recreate the specific item part. I’d appreciate your thoughts here.) 4.1.2 Coupon Info You can view information about existing coupons by selecting them in the search box in the top.
