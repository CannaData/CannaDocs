Each client receives their own Virtual Private Cloud where their data is securely stored. When you create an account with CannaData you will be given a unique URL for your dispensary. For example, a dispensary named “demo” would likely receive the domain https://demo.cannadata.com where they can access the CannaData platform. This documentation explains how to use the CannaData platform. 1.1 Contact We love getting feedback! Please email Carl Ganz "],
["frontdesk.html", "Chapter 2 Frontdesk 2.1 Sidebar 2.2 Returning Patients 2.3 New Patients 2.4 Online Orders", " Chapter 2 Frontdesk The Frontdesk is where every dispensary first makes contact with their clients. Dispensaries must keep track of all customers and verify that they are valid medical marijuana patients. The CannaData Frontdesk page makes this easy by providing a custom interface for checking in and accepting new patients. 2.1 Sidebar On the left of the page is a sidebar with five options. The five subpages are: Homepage: where you can view who is currently in the store, in queue, and pending online orders. All Patients: where you can see all past patients, and incomplete profiles. Patient Info: when a specific patient is selected this page will display their information, and allow you to let the patient into your store. New Patient: when a new patient is processed, this is the page where you enter their information. Online Sale: when processing an online order, this page will display the order info, and provide options for completing the order. 2.2 Returning Patients For returning clients, the front desk is responsible for: Validating a person is who they say they are Confirming they are a medical marijuana patient Controlling how many customers are allowed in the store at one time, and making sure that they are processed in the correct order If the patient preordered, making sure their preorder is processed correctly All patient interactions begin by scanning the client’s state issued ID. For returning customers this will pull up the patient’s profile where the budtender can quickly see the patient’s current medical status, as well as other basic information about the patient. With a single button press, valid patients can be allowed into the store, or if there is a line to get in, added to the patient queue. Returning Patient Info The patient info page provides basic data about the patient, as well as their medical info. The box at the top displays the number of days left until the patient’s medical card expires. When expired, the box is red. Expired Patient The page also displays the number of reward points the patient has accumulated, and a pie chart with the product types from the patient’s purchase history. Patient Data You can view details of past transactions by selecting a row from the patient history table. Past Transaction For patients with expired medical cards, the patient info page lets you edit and update the patient’s medical info. You can also access a patient’s info page by scanning their ID, searching for them in search box at the top, or by selecting them from the All Patients tab. All Patient Table The All Patients tab also allows you to view, which patient profiles are incomplete, and which registered patients have expired medical cards. 2.2.1 Queue The homepage of the Frontdesk app keeps track of online sales, who is currently in the store, and who is currently in line to get in the store (queue). These tables make it easy to see who is next in line, and how long people have been waiting. Online sales are discussed in greater detail here. Queue 2.3 New Patients For new patients, when their ID is scanned a message will appear indicating that the patient is new. The budtender has the option to add the new patient which initiates the patient sign-up process. Add New Patient Screen When the patient’s ID is first scanned, the information from their ID is automatically added, however their profile is incomplete. The budtender must upload the patient’s documents, and enter a small amount of information from the patient’s medical card, specifically the name of their doctor, the expiration date, and the medical card ID number. Empty New Patient Form Completed New Patient Form While the budtender enters this information, the patient is presented with an iPad (or other tablet or computer) where they enter their information into the Signup application discussed below. 2.3.1 Signup The Signup application works in conjunction with the Frontdesk app to let new patients quickly join a dispensary. When a new patient’s ID is scanned they are added to the database, but their profile is incomplete. The budtender must input the patient’s medical information (discussed above), and the patient must complete the signup form (and sign the patient agreement), before they can enter the store. The first page of the signup form contains an input where the budtender can select the incomplete profile of the new patient. Typically there is only one incomplete profile at a time, in which case the one incomplete profile is automatically selected. The budtender would hand the iPad over to the new patient who would fill out the rest of the form. The first page of the signup form is automatically filled in based on the information on the patient’s driver’s license. Autofilled Basic Info There are four additional pages where the patient fills in their contact info, and preferences. Contact Info Preference Info Preference Info Other Info After the patient completes the form they are automatically sent to DocuSign where they digitally sign the new patient agreement contract. This makes the signup process completely paperless. 2.4 Online Orders Whenever new online orders are made a notification will appear in the bottom right corner of the frontdesk app, and the new order will appear in the online orders table in the homepage. We will discuss the online menu, and online ordering process in more detail in the Online Orders chapter, so for now we will just focus on processing online orders at the frontdesk. New Online Order When you first receive a new order it is unconfirmed. Select the order by either pressing the alert in the bottom right, selecting the order in the table in the homepage, or by selecting the order in the search bar at the top. Online Order Info The order info page allows you to do several things: You can edit items Edit Online Order Print labels Select printer for labels Confirm Send confirmation message Cancel Send cancellation message Once an order is confirmed the alert in the corner will go away, and the status in the main table will update. Confirmed order Patient is checked in When the patient comes to pick up their order you must check them in like any other patient, as discussed above. Once they are checked in you link the online order with the checked in patient by clicking the “Link” button in the online order page. Link button Once the order is linked to the patient, they can proceed to the cash register where they can quickly complete the transaction. "],
["inventory.html", "Chapter 3 Inventory 3.1 Sidebar 3.2 New Inventory 3.3 Past Products 3.4 Wholesaler 3.5 New Wholesalers 3.6 Labels", " Chapter 3 Inventory The Inventory Management application provides facilities for: Adding new inventory and new wholesalers Viewing the performance of past products and wholesalers Checking quantities of current stock Updating/editing information about existing products Print labels/barcodes for inventory 3.1 Sidebar On the left of the page is a sidebar with four options. The four subpages are: Inventory: where you can view all current, and past inventory, as well as all wholesalers. Product Info: when a specific product is selected this page will display information about the product. New Product: this page lets you enter new inventory. Wholesaler: when a product is selected this page shows information about the product’s wholesaler. When a wholesaler is selected this page displays information about the wholesaler. 3.2 New Inventory The new inventory page allows you to enter new shipments of inventory into your database. There are several required fields in the new inventory form: Product Type (i.e. flower vs concentrate vs edible etc.) Strain (No strain is an option, but must be explicitly selected) Wholesaler Wholesale price Quantity Price There are also several optional inputs, and inputs that are only required sometimes: Product Name (required if no strain selected) URL Specific Product Type (i.e. is concentrate wax/shatter/kief? is edible cookie/brownie/cheeseburger?) Description THC &amp; CBD levels Whether product is Indica/Sativa/Hybrid Image Source product and quantity (i.e. if you take 50 grams of Banana OG and make 75 joints, when you enter the 75 joints you would also want to remove the 50 grams of Banana OG that the joints are derived from) 3.2.1 Pricing The price input contains default values based on the product type. Whenever a value in the price input is updated, the rows below the changed value, representing the price for larger quantities, are updated to be consistent with the new value. For example, the default price for concentrates is $30 per half gram. This rate is used for higher quantities so 1 gram is $30*2=$60, two grams is $30*4=$120, etc. We can update the price for two grams to $100, which translates to $50 per gram. Now all quantities above two grams are priced at the $50 per gram rate, while all quantities below two grams retain the $30 per half gram ($60 per gram) rate. Price Input with 2 g level manually set to $100 3.3 Past Products Details about existing and past products are easily accessible. You can search for any inventory or wholesaler in the search box at the top. You can also view tables containing current inventory, old inventory, and wholesalers on the main page.

Alternatively, when you select a product the wholesaler page displays info for that product’s wholesaler. Wholesaler Info Analytics about the wholesaler including daily sales, average daily profit, and product type. Wholesaler Analytics 3.5 New Wholesalers New wholesalers can be added in either the new inventory page: New Wholesaler in New Inventory Page Or in the wholesaler info page: New Wholesaler in Wholesaler Info Page 3.6 Labels Many dispensaries use labels and barcodes to organize their inventory. There are two frameworks for using labels: Prepackage all products in advance Keep products in larger container, and weigh out and package for each sale like a deli The second method is the most common, and it typically requires printing one or two labels to place on the primary container. The first method involves printing out a label for each prepackaged unit. The product info page has a “print label” button, which provides the user with a choice of either printing simple labels for the second method, or prepackaging the product. Select label type and printer If you select prepackage, you must enter the quantity being prepackaged, and the number of packages (i.e. if you plan on packaging 25 1/8th containers you would enter 3.5 grams, and 25 packages) Prepackage prompt Labels contain QR codes, which internally function as regular barcodes. Outside of the application, the QR codes point to the item’s info page on your online menu. Simple labels are primarily used internally. Simple Label Prepackage labels display display the quantity. Prepackage label More detailed labels are printed at point of sale when item is not prepackaged. "],
