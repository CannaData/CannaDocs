Each client receives their own Virtual Private Cloud instance where their data is securely stored. When you create an account with CannaData you will be given a unique url for your dispensary. For example, a dispensary named “storename” would likely receive the domain https://storename.cannadata.com where they can securely access the CannaData platform. An elegent, and up-to-date menu is readily available at https://storename.cannadata.com/apps/menu/, which can easily be integrated into your dispensaries webpage. CannaData is not simply a piece of software. We are your go-to data, and technology consultant. Once your dispensary is integrated into our data pipeline, we offer a variety of custom business services including reporting/analytics, tax planning, A/B testing for marketing campaigns, patient surveys, and more. This documentation explains how to use the CannaData platform. 1.1 Contact We love getting feedback! Please email Carl Ganz "],
["frontdesk.html", "Chapter 2 Frontdesk 2.1 Returning Patients 2.2 New Patients", " Chapter 2 Frontdesk The Frontdesk is where every dispensary first makes contact with their clients. Dispensaries must keep track of all customers, and verify that they are valid medical marijuana patients. The CannnaData Frontdesk application provides facilities for checking-in and accepting new customers. 2.1 Returning Patients For returning clients, the front desk is responsible for: Validating a person is who they say they are Confirming they are a medical marijuana patient Controlling how many customers are allowed in the store at one time, and making sure that they are processed in the correct order All patient interactions begin by scanning the client’s state issued ID. For returning customers this will pull up the patient’s profile where the budtender can quickly see the patient’s current medical status, as well as other basic information about the patient. For valid patients, there are buttons for letting the patient directly into the store, or if there is a line to get in to the store, they can add the patient to the queue. Returning Patient Info The patient info page provides basic data about the patient, as well as their medical info. The box at the top displays the number of days left until the patient’s medical card expires. When expired, the box is red. Expired Patient There are two graphs, one displaying the number of reward points the patient has accumulated, and a pie chart representing the product types from the patient’s purchase history. Patient Data You can view details of past transactions by selecting a row from the patient history table. Past Transaction For patients with expired medical cards, the patient info page lets you edit, and update the patients medical info. You can also access a patient’s info page by either searching for them in search box at the top, or by selecting them from the All Patients tab. All Patient Table The All Patients tab also allows you to view, which patient profiles are incomplete, and which registered patients have expired medical cards. 2.1.1 Queue The homepage of the Frontdesk app keeps track of who is currently in the store, and who is currently in line to get in the store (queue). These tables make it easy to see who is next in line, and how long people have been waiting. Queue 2.2 New Patients For new patients, when their ID is scanned a message will appear indicating that the patient is new. The budtender has the option to add the new patient which initiates the patient sign-up process. Add New Patient Screen When the patient’s ID is first scanned, the information from their ID is automatically added. The budtender uploads the patient’s documents, and enter a small amount of information from the patient’s medical card, specifically the name of their doctor, the expiration date, and the medical card ID number. Empty New Patient Form Completed New Patient Form While the budtender enters this information, the patient is presented with an iPad (or other tablet or computer) where they enter their information into the Signup application discussed below. 2.2.1 Signup The Signup application works in conjunction with the Frontdesk app to let new patients quickly join a dispensary. When a new patient’s ID is scanned they are added to the database, but their profile is incomplete. The budtender must input the patient’s medical information (discussed above), and the patient must complete the signup form (and sign the patient agreement), before they can enter the store. The first page of the signup form contains an input where the budtender can select the incomplete profile of the new patient. If only one patient is signing up they will automatically be selected. Once the incomplete profile is selected the budtender would hand the iPad over to the new patient who would fill out the rest of the form. The first page of the signup form is automatically filled in based on the information on the patient’s driver’s license. Autofilled Basic Info There are four additional pages where the patient fills in their contact info, and preferences. Contact Info Preference Info Preference Info Other Info After the patient completes the form they are automatically sent to DocuSign where they digitally sign the new patient agreement contract. This makes the signup process completely paperless. "],

Digitally managing inventory doesn’t just make it easier to keep track of products, but it also simplifies the record keeping process required for taxes, and other regulations. There are several required fields in the new inventory form: Product Type (i.e. flower vs concentrate vs edible etc.) Strain (No strain is an option, but must be explicitely selected) Wholesaler Wholesale price Quantity Price There are also several optional inputs, and inputs that are only required sometimes: Product Name (required if no strain selected) Specific Product Type (i.e. is concentrate wax/shatter/kief? is edible cookie/brownie/cheeseburger?) Description THC &amp; CBD levels Whether product is Indica/Sativa/Hybrid Image Source product and quantity (i.e. if you take 50 grams of Banana OG and make 75 joints, when you enter the 75 joints you would also want to remove the 50 grams of Banana OG that the joints are derived from) 3.1.1 Pricing The price input contains default values based on the product type. Whenever a value in the price input is updated, the rows below the changed value, representing the price for larger quantities, are updated to be consistent with the new value. For example, the default price for concentrates is $30 per half gram. This rate is used for higher quantities so 1 gram is $30*2=$60, two grams is $30*4=$120, etc. We can update the price for two grams to $100, which translates to $50 per gram. Now all quantities above two grams are priced at the $50 per gram rate, while all quantities below two grams retain the $30 per half gram ($60 per gram) rate. Price Input with 2 g level manually set to $100 3.2 Past Products Details about existing and past products are easily accessible. You can search for any inventory or wholesaler in the search box at the top. You can also view tables containing current inventory, old inventory, and wholesalers on the main page.

Alternatively, when you select a product the wholesaler page displays info for that product’s wholesaler. Wholesaler Info Analytics about the wholesaler including daily sales, average daily profit, and product type. Wholesaler Analytics 3.4 New Wholesalers New wholesalers can be added in either the new inventory page: New Wholesaler in New Inventory Page Or in the wholesaler info page: New Wholesaler in Wholesaler Info Page 3.5 Labels Many dispensaries use labels and barcodes to organize their inventory. There are two frameworks for using labels: Prepackage all products in advance Keep products in larger container, and weigh out and package for each sale like a deli The second method is the most common, and it typically requires printing one or two labels to place on the primary container. The first method involves printing out a label for each prepackaged unit. The product info page has a “print label” button, which provides the user with a choice of either printing simple labels for the second method, or prepackaging the product. "],
