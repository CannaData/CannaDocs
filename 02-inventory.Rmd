The Inventory Management application provides facilities for:

* Adding new inventory and new wholesalers

* Viewing the performance of past products and wholesalers

* Checking quantities of current stock

* Updating/editing information about existing products

* Print labels/barcodes for inventory

## New Inventory

The new inventory page allows you to enter new shipments of inventory into your database. Digitally managing inventory doesn't just make it easier to keep track of products, but it also simplifies the record keeping process required for taxes, and other regulations.

There are several required fields in the new inventory form:

* Product Type (i.e. flower vs concentrate vs edible etc.)

* Strain (No strain is an option, but must be explicitely selected)

* Wholesaler

* Wholesale price

* Quantity

* Price

There are also several optional inputs, and inputs that are only required sometimes:

* Product Name (required if no strain selected)

* Specific Product Type (i.e. is concentrate wax/shatter/kief? is edible cookie/brownie/cheeseburger?)

* Description

* THC & CBD levels

* Whether product is Indica/Sativa/Hybrid

* Image

* Source product and quantity (i.e. if you take 50 grams of Banana OG and make 75 joints, when you enter the 75 joints you would also want to remove the 50 grams of Banana OG that the joints are derived from)


### Pricing

The price input contains default values based on the product type. Whenever a value in the price input is updated, the rows below the changed value, representing the price for larger quantities, are updated to be consistent with the new value. For example, the default price for concentrates is \$30 per half gram. This rate is used for higher quantities so 1 gram is \$30\*2=\$60, two grams is \$30\*4=\$120, etc. We can update the price for two grams to \$100, which translates to \$50 per gram. Now all quantities above two grams are priced at the \$50 per gram rate, while all quantities below two grams retain the \$30 per half gram (\$60 per gram) rate.

## Past Products

Details about existing and past products are easily accessible. You can search for any inventory or wholesaler in the search box at the top. You can also view tables containing current inventory, old inventory, and wholesalers on the main page.

When you select an item you are taken to the product information page. This includes a variety of tables regarding the specific product with the option to edit. Buttons at the top allow to quickly add more inventory and print barcodes for the product.

Basic analytics are provided so you can quickly see how the product is performing. Daily sales are charted, and average daily profit is rated against other similar products.

## Wholesaler

You can also view information about individual wholesalers. You can select a wholesaler in the search bar at the top or in the wholesaler table in the homepage. Alternatively, when you select a product the wholesaler page displays info for that product's wholesaler.

## Labels

Many dispensaries use labels and barcodes to organize their inventory. There are two frameworks for using labels:

1. Prepackage all products in advance 

2. Keep products in larger container, and weigh out and package for each sale like a deli

The second method is the most common, and it typically requires printing one or two labels to place on the primary container. The first method involves printing out a label for each prepackaged unit. 

The product info page has a "print label" button, which provides the user with a choice of either printing *simple* labels for the second method, or prepackaging the product.
