\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{preliminaries}

The CannaData platform enables Marijuana dispensaries to manage their
patients, inventory, point-of-sales, and online presence with one
integrated platform. Each client receives their own Virtual Private
Cloud where their data is securely stored. When you create an account
with CannaData you will be given a unique URL for your dispensary. For
example, a dispensary named ``demo'' would likely receive the domain
\url{https://demo.cannadata.com} where they can access the CannaData
platform.

This documentation explains how to use the CannaData platform.

\section{Contact}\label{contact}

We love getting feedback! Please email
\href{mailto:carl@cannadatasolutions.com}{Carl Ganz}

\chapter{Frontdesk}\label{frontdesk}

The Frontdesk is where every dispensary first makes contact with their
clients. Dispensaries must keep track of all customers and verify that
they are valid medical marijuana patients. The CannaData Frontdesk page
makes this easy by providing a custom interface for checking in and
accepting new patients.

\section{Sidebar}\label{sidebar}

On the left of the page is a sidebar with five options. The five
subpages are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Homepage: where you can view who is currently in the store, in queue,
  and pending online orders.
\item
  All Patients: where you can see all past patients, and incomplete
  profiles.
\item
  Patient Info: when a specific patient is selected this page will
  display their information, and allow you to let the patient into your
  store.
\item
  New Patient: when a new patient is processed, this is the page where
  you enter their information.
\item
  Online Sale: when processing an online order, this page will display
  the order info, and provide options for completing the order.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{returning-patients}{\section{Returning
Patients}\label{returning-patients}}

For returning clients, the front desk is responsible for:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Validating a person is who they say they are
\item
  Confirming they are a medical marijuana patient
\item
  Controlling how many customers are allowed in the store at one time,
  and making sure that they are processed in the correct order
\item
  If the patient preordered, making sure their preorder is processed
  correctly
\end{itemize}

All patient interactions begin by scanning the client's state issued ID.
For returning customers this will pull up the patient's profile where
the budtender can quickly see the patient's current medical status, as
well as other basic information about the patient. With a single button
press, valid patients can be allowed into the store, or if there is a
line to get in, added to the patient queue.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/patientInfo.png}
\caption{Returning Patient Info}
\end{figure}

The patient info page provides basic data about the patient, as well as
their medical info. The box at the top displays the number of days left
until the patient's medical card expires. When expired, the box is red.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/expired.png}
\caption{Expired Patient}
\end{figure}

The page also displays the number of reward points the patient has
accumulated, and a pie chart with the product types from the patient's
purchase history.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/patientInfo2.png}
\caption{Patient Data}
\end{figure}

You can view details of past transactions by selecting a row from the
patient history table.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/pastTransaction.png}
\caption{Past Transaction}
\end{figure}

For patients with expired medical cards, the patient info page lets you
edit and update the patient's medical info.

\includegraphics{images/edit1.png} \includegraphics{images/edit2.png}

You can also access a patient's info page by scanning their ID,
searching for them in search box at the top, or by selecting them from
the All Patients tab.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/allPatients.png}
\caption{All Patient Table}
\end{figure}

The All Patients tab also allows you to view, which patient profiles are
incomplete, and which registered patients have expired medical cards.

\subsection{Queue}\label{queue}

The homepage of the Frontdesk app keeps track of online sales, who is
currently in the store, and who is currently in line to get in the store
(queue). These tables make it easy to see who is next in line, and how
long people have been waiting. Online sales are discussed in greater
detail \protect\hyperlink{online-orders}{here}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/queue.png}
\caption{Queue}
\end{figure}

\section{New Patients}\label{new-patients}

For new patients, when their ID is scanned a message will appear
indicating that the patient is new. The budtender has the option to add
the new patient which initiates the patient sign-up process.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/addnew.png}
\caption{Add New Patient Screen}
\end{figure}

When the patient's ID is first scanned, the information from their ID is
automatically added, however their profile is incomplete. The budtender
must upload the patient's documents, and enter a small amount of
information from the patient's medical card, specifically the name of
their doctor, the expiration date, and the medical card ID number.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/newPatient.png}
\caption{Empty New Patient Form}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/newPatient2.png}
\caption{Completed New Patient Form}
\end{figure}

While the budtender enters this information, the patient is presented
with an iPad (or other tablet or computer) where they enter their
information into the Signup application discussed below.

\subsection{Signup}\label{signup}

The Signup application works in conjunction with the Frontdesk app to
let new patients quickly join a dispensary. When a new patient's ID is
scanned they are added to the database, but their profile is incomplete.
The budtender must input the patient's medical information (discussed
above), and the patient must complete the signup form (and sign the
patient agreement), before they can enter the store. The first page of
the signup form contains an input where the budtender can select the
incomplete profile of the new patient. Typically there is only one
incomplete profile at a time, in which case the one incomplete profile
is automatically selected.

The budtender would hand the iPad over to the new patient who would fill
out the rest of the form. The first page of the signup form is
automatically filled in based on the information on the patient's
driver's license.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/S1.png}
\caption{Autofilled Basic Info}
\end{figure}

There are four additional pages where the patient fills in their contact
info, and preferences.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/S4.png}
\caption{Contact Info}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/S2.png}
\caption{Preference Info}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/S3.png}
\caption{Preference Info}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/S5.png}
\caption{Other Info}
\end{figure}

After the patient completes the form they are automatically sent to
DocuSign where they digitally sign the new patient agreement contract.
This makes the signup process completely paperless.

\hypertarget{online-orders}{\section{Online
Orders}\label{online-orders}}

Whenever new online orders are made a notification will appear in the
bottom right corner of the frontdesk app, and the new order will appear
in the online orders table in the homepage. We will discuss the online
menu, and online ordering process in more detail in the
\href{online.html}{Online Orders chapter}, so for now we will just focus
on processing online orders at the frontdesk.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online1.png}
\caption{New Online Order}
\end{figure}

When you first receive a new order it is unconfirmed. Select the order
by either pressing the alert in the bottom right, selecting the order in
the table in the homepage, or by selecting the order in the search bar
at the top.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online2.png}
\caption{Online Order Info}
\end{figure}

The order info page allows you to do several things:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You can edit items
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online3.png}
\caption{Edit Online Order}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Print labels
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online4.png}
\caption{Select printer for labels}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Confirm
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online5.png}
\caption{Send confirmation message}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cancel
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online6.png}
\caption{Send cancellation message}
\end{figure}

Once an order is confirmed the alert in the corner will go away, and the
status in the main table will update.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online7.png}
\caption{Confirmed order}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online8.png}
\caption{Patient is checked in}
\end{figure}

When the patient comes to pick up their order you must check them in
like any other patient, as
\protect\hyperlink{returning-patients}{discussed above}. Once they are
checked in you link the online order with the checked in patient by
clicking the ``Link'' button in the online order page.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/online10.png}
\caption{Link button}
\end{figure}

\includegraphics{images/online9.png} Once the order is linked to the
patient, they can proceed to the cash register where they can quickly
complete the transaction.

\chapter{Inventory}\label{inventory}

The Inventory Management application provides facilities for:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Adding new inventory and new wholesalers
\item
  Viewing the performance of past products and wholesalers
\item
  Checking quantities of current stock
\item
  Updating/editing information about existing products
\item
  Print labels/barcodes for inventory
\end{itemize}

\section{Sidebar}\label{sidebar-1}

On the left of the page is a sidebar with four options. The four
subpages are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Inventory: where you can view all current, and past inventory, as well
  as all wholesalers.
\item
  Product Info: when a specific product is selected this page will
  display information about the product.
\item
  New Product: this page lets you enter new inventory.
\item
  Wholesaler: when a product is selected this page shows information
  about the product's wholesaler. When a wholesaler is selected this
  page displays information about the wholesaler.
\end{itemize}

\section{New Inventory}\label{new-inventory}

The new inventory page allows you to enter new shipments of inventory
into your database. \includegraphics{images/newInv1.png}
\includegraphics{images/newInv2.png}

\includegraphics{images/newInv3.png}
\includegraphics{images/newInv4.png}

There are several required fields in the new inventory form:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Product Type (i.e.~flower vs concentrate vs edible etc.)
\item
  Strain (No strain is an option, but must be explicitly selected)
\item
  Wholesaler
\item
  Wholesale price
\item
  Quantity
\item
  Price
\end{itemize}

There are also several optional inputs, and inputs that are only
required sometimes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Product Name (required if no strain selected)
\item
  URL
\item
  Specific Product Type (i.e.~is concentrate wax/shatter/kief? is edible
  cookie/brownie/cheeseburger?)
\item
  Description
\item
  THC \& CBD levels
\item
  Whether product is Indica/Sativa/Hybrid
\item
  Image
\item
  Source product and quantity (i.e.~if you take 50 grams of Banana OG
  and make 75 joints, when you enter the 75 joints you would also want
  to remove the 50 grams of Banana OG that the joints are derived from)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pricing}\label{pricing}

The price input contains default values based on the product type.
Whenever a value in the price input is updated, the rows below the
changed value, representing the price for larger quantities, are updated
to be consistent with the new value. For example, the default price for
concentrates is \$30 per half gram. This rate is used for higher
quantities so 1 gram is \$30*2=\$60, two grams is \$30*4=\$120, etc. We
can update the price for two grams to \$100, which translates to \$50
per gram. Now all quantities above two grams are priced at the \$50 per
gram rate, while all quantities below two grams retain the \$30 per half
gram (\$60 per gram) rate.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/I3.png}
\caption{Price Input with 2 g level manually set to \$100}
\end{figure}

\section{Past Products}\label{past-products}

Details about existing and past products are easily accessible. You can
search for any inventory or wholesaler in the search box at the top. You
can also view tables containing current inventory, old inventory, and
wholesalers on the main page.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/inventory.png}
\caption{Current Inventory Table}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/inventory2.png}
\caption{Old Inventory and Wholesalers}
\end{figure}

When you select an item you are taken to the product information page.
This includes several tables regarding the specific product with the
option to edit. Buttons at the top allow to quickly add more inventory
and print barcodes for the product.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/productInfo.png}
\caption{Current Inventory Table}
\end{figure}

Basic analytics are provided so you can quickly see how the product is
performing. Daily sales are charted, and average daily profit is rated
against other similar products.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/productInfo2.png}
\caption{Current Inventory Table}
\end{figure}

\section{Wholesaler}\label{wholesaler}

You can also view information about individual wholesalers. You can
select a wholesaler in the search bar at the top or in the wholesaler
table in the homepage. Alternatively, when you select a product the
wholesaler page displays info for that product's wholesaler.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/wholesaler.png}
\caption{Wholesaler Info}
\end{figure}

Analytics about the wholesaler including daily sales, average daily
profit, and product type.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/wholesaler2.png}
\caption{Wholesaler Analytics}
\end{figure}

\section{New Wholesalers}\label{new-wholesalers}

New wholesalers can be added in either the new inventory page:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/newWholesaler.png}
\caption{New Wholesaler in New Inventory Page}
\end{figure}

Or in the wholesaler info page:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/newWholesaler2.png}
\caption{New Wholesaler in Wholesaler Info Page}
\end{figure}

\section{Labels}\label{labels}

Many dispensaries use labels and barcodes to organize their inventory.
There are two frameworks for using labels:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Prepackage all products in advance
\item
  Keep products in larger container, and weigh out and package for each
  sale like a deli
\end{enumerate}

The second method is the most common, and it typically requires printing
one or two labels to place on the primary container. The first method
involves printing out a label for each prepackaged unit.

The product info page has a ``print label'' button, which provides the
user with a choice of either printing \emph{simple} labels for the
second method, or prepackaging the product.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/label1.png}
\caption{Select label type and printer}
\end{figure}

If you select prepackage, you must enter the quantity being prepackaged,
and the number of packages (i.e.~if you plan on packaging 25 1/8th
containers you would enter 3.5 grams, and 25 packages)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/label2.png}
\caption{Prepackage prompt}
\end{figure}

Labels contain QR codes, which internally function as regular barcodes.
Outside of the application, the QR codes point to the item's info page
on your online menu.

Simple labels are primarily used internally.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/simplelabel.png}
\caption{Simple Label}
\end{figure}

Prepackage labels display display the quantity.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/prepackagelabel.png}
\caption{Prepackage label}
\end{figure}

More detailed \href{point-of-sales.html\#labels-1}{labels are printed at
point of sale} when item is not prepackaged.

\chapter{Point of Sales}\label{point-of-sales}

The point-of-sales application provides facilities for:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Viewing patient info
\item
  Viewing current inventory
\item
  Processing transactions
\end{itemize}

\section{Patient Selection}\label{patient-selection}

Most transaction begin by selecting the patient. The list of checked-in
patients is available in the navbar.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P1.png}
\caption{Checked-in Patients can be selected in navbar}
\end{figure}

If you scan a barcode, or select an item without choosing a patient
first you must select the patient when adding the item to the cart.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/cart1.png}
\caption{Select patient when adding to cart}
\end{figure}

\section{Patient Info}\label{patient-info}

Once a patient is selected, their information appears at the top.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P2.png}
\caption{Patient info appears once patient is selected}
\end{figure}

More information about the patient is available by pressing the eyeball
to the top right of the patient information.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P3.png}
\caption{Detailed info about the patient}
\end{figure}

This provides details about the patient's purchase history, as well as
the specifics of the patient's previous transactions.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P4.png}
\caption{Details from patient's previous transaction}
\end{figure}

\section{Sales}\label{sales}

There are two ways to add an item to the cart: by scanning a barcode, or
by selecting an item from the inventory table. When scanned, or
selected, the budtender is prompted to enter the exact information about
the sale: the quantity sold, and the price. The budtender also has the
option of applying a discount. (The discount info is automatically
populated if you \href{connect.html\#coupons}{register the coupon in the
connect app} i.e.~if you create Wax Wednesday the discount will
automatically populate for concentrates on Wednesdays)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P5.png}
\caption{Adding 1/4th of an Oz of Banana OG}
\end{figure}

You can enter arbitrary quantities, and it will determine the price.
Discounts can be added as either flat rates (i.e. \$10) or percentages.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P6.png}
\caption{Adding 21 grams of Banana OG, and applying Happy Hour discount}
\end{figure}

When added, the item appears in the cart. This information is not
session specific so you can leave the app, or process another patient's
transaction, and when you return the item will remain in the patient's
cart.

Item's in the cart can be edited by pressing the green pencil.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P7.png}
\caption{Cart after adding Banana OG}
\end{figure}

\section{Labels}\label{labels-1}

When non-prepackaged flower, or concentrate is added to cart a label is
generated. The QR points to the product's info page on your web menu.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/poslabel.png}
\caption{Label generated at sale}
\end{figure}

\section{Searching}\label{searching}

When not using a barcode, it is often useful to search for the item you
are entering by name. You can also search for items by various
attributes like product type, strain name, strain type, and description.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P8.png}
\caption{Searching for flower in inventory}
\end{figure}

\section{Completing Transaction}\label{completing-transaction}

To complete the transaction press the green ``charge'' button on the
bottom right. This will prompt the budtender to enter the amount of cash
tendered. The budtender can enter the amount by either entering the
bills (i.e.~if budtender is handed two twenties and a ten they press
\$20, \$20, \$10) or by simply entering the amount (i.e.~press 5 then
0).

\includegraphics{images/P9.png} \includegraphics{images/P10.png}

Once the amount paid is submitted, the amount of change is returned, and
the transaction is complete.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/P11.png}
\caption{After submitting amount paid, the amount of charge is given}
\end{figure}

A receipt is generated with your logo, and a QR code pointing to a
online survey about the products they purchased.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/receipt.png}
\caption{Receipt with CannaData logo}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Connect}\label{connect}

Many dispensaries try to encourage patients to come to their store with
coupons, and targeted messages. The Connect Application provides
facilities for:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Creating coupons/deals
\item
  Reaching out to patients via text, or email
\end{itemize}

\section{Sidebar}\label{sidebar-2}

On the left of the page is a sidebar with five options. The five
subpages are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Homepage: where you can view all coupons, and past messages.
\item
  New Coupon: where new coupons can be created.
\item
  Coupon Info: when a coupon is selected this page displays information
  about the coupon.
\item
  New Message: where new messages can be created.
\item
  Message Info: when a message is selected this page displays
  information about the message.
\end{itemize}

\section{Homepage}\label{homepage}

The homepage has tables listing all coupons, and past messages. You can
view more information about a coupon or message by pressing the info
button in the homepage or by selecting the item in the search bar at the
top.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/connect1.png}
\caption{Homepage}
\end{figure}

\section{Coupons}\label{coupons}

\subsection{New Coupons}\label{new-coupons}

The required information for a new coupon is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A name
\item
  A discount (either a flat amount i.e. \$10, or a percentage i.e.~10\%)
\item
  A minimum quantity or amount (either a minimum total amount spent i.e.
  \$60, or a quantity i.e.~3.5 grams)
\item
  Which products the discount applies to. Options include:
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Total (i.e.~take 10\% off total bill)
\item
  All products of a certain type (i.e.~on Wax Wednesdays you discount
  \textbf{all} concentrates)
\item
  All products of a strain type (i.e.~Sativa Saturday)
\item
  Specific products
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Lastly you have to choose when the coupon is active
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
